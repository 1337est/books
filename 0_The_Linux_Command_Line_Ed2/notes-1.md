# **Ch1**: Key Concepts
- Learning about the shell. What it looks like, what it feels like, what it tastes like.

# **Ch1**: Summarization
- The command line refers to the shell. The shell is a program that uses keyboard commands to pass instructions to the OS. Almost all Linux distros have a shell called "bash".
- When using a GUI, you likely need a terminal emulator.
- KDE uses konsole
- GNOME uses gnome-terminal
- Pressing CTRL-ALT-(F1 through F6) will access different login sessions, prompting you to login with your username and password.

## Commands
- `date` - displays current date & time.
- `cal` - a calendar for the current month.
- `df` - Shows the disk space that's free on your hard drives.
    - I'll be using `duf` on Arch, as it's a cleaner/nicer looking df.
- `free` - Shows the free RAM space in your machine.
- `exit` - self explanatory

# **Ch1**: Code Snippets
A normal shell prompt looks like this:
```bash
[username@machine /current/working/directory/path] $
```
While a root or super user terminal will have the $ replaced by a #:
```bash
[username@machine /current/working/directory/path] #
```

# **Ch1**: Thoughts
- I hear Sally has some fancy sea shells she's selling by the ocean shore.
