# Books/

The Books/ directory is dedicated to housing the programming books that I am currently studying. Within this directory, you will find a collection of books that I am actively working through. Each book includes its associated code or programs that are part of the learning process as outlined in the book's exercises or tutorials.

## Structure:

- **1_Book_Title/**
    - This subdirectory contains the materials related to Book 1. It includes the code snippets, programs, or projects that I am developing while studying the book. I'm a believer that there is no point in reading without applying your knowledge.
    - `notes.md`: My notes and observations related to Book 1. Here I'll summarize, highlight key concepts, and share insights I've gained from reading Book 1.

## Notes:

- **Purpose of Notes**: The `notes.md` files in each book's subdirectory serve as my personal knowledge repository. They help me track my progress, understand concepts better, and refer back to important information.

- **Format of Notes**: The notes are organized into sections such as "Key Concepts", "Challenges Faced", "Code Snippets", "Ideas for Projects", and "Thoughts". This structured format aids in quick reference and comprehension. The notes section isn't a regurgitation of the source material, but a summary in my own words to better digest and keep down the content.

- **Usefulness**: Keeping detailed notes alongside the book materials enhances my learning experience by reinforcing concepts, clarifying doubts, and fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

By maintaining this structured Books/ directory and accompanying notes, I can effectively manage my learning journey and extract maximum value from the programming books I study.
